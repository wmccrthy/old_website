                In my coursework at Amherst College, I have focused largely on computer science and economics. Throughout, I have completed several courses relevant to software engineering, including data structures, algorithms, and artificial intelligence, and I will soon (as of Spring 2023) have completed computer systems and algorithm visualization. I have also worked on several projects that have given me practical experience in developing and implementing software solutions. In particular, I have significant experience programming in Java and Python, as well as some experience with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have used these skills to develop projects such as a pathfinding algorithm visualizer, a checkers game with a minimax AI that plays against the user, various artificial intelligence agents for Pacman, and an undeployed personal website.
                My pathfinding visualizer supports breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and A* search; users can run these algorithms on variations of the initial grids, which can be modified by adding walls and weighting nodes. In my from-scratch Checkers AI, I spent extensive time optimizing the minimax algorithm using various techniques such as alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables. I further analyzed the runtime of my algorithm over thousands of trials to identify edge cases, debug accordingly, and ensure that the optimization techniques worked as intended. In the projects I have done regarding Pacman I was tasked with implementing various algorithms for performing search, adversarial search, and reinforcement learning within a Pacman game. Some of the notable algorithms I successfully implemented throughout the semester were A*, Minimax, Expectiminimax, Q-Learning, and Particle Filtering. 
                These three projects particularly strengthened my grasp of computer science fundamentals related to data structures and algorithms. I found myself practically employing highly technical solutions that applied algorithms and concepts I had previously only encountered in theoretical settings like the classroom. Combining theoretical and empirical practice, these projects greatly enhanced my understanding of the used algorithms and general algorithmic thinking; I was truly able to get a feel for transforming abstract concepts into concrete solutions that catered to the purpose and code of whatever project I was working on. Most importantly, these endeavors taught me efficient strategies to approach learning and implementing novel concepts and techniques. 
                Despite having no prior professional experience in the software engineering field, I am confident that my work ethic and determination will make up for any initial naivety.
